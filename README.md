### CL-RDFXML â€” An RDF/XML Parser for Common Lisp

There are now a number of libraries for processing some of the technologies upon which
RDF/XML is built. Particularly, [Closure XML](http://common-lisp.net/project/cxml/) is a robust, mature XML parser, and
manipulation of URIs is easy using [Puri](http://puri.b9.com/).

This RDF/XML parser builds upon these libraries so as to minimize the amount of code that
is not directly related to parsing RDF/XML, and provides a simple interface for extracting
triples from RDF/XML documents.

Documentation generated by [documentation-template](http://weitz.de/documentation-template/)
is available at the [project's prior home](http://www.cs.rpi.edu//~tayloj/CL-RDFXML/).
